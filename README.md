# Msingi1: A Small Swahili Language Model

Msingi1 is an experimental Swahili language model trained from scratch using PyTorch. This project aims to create a foundation model for Swahili text processing and generation.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code for model architecture and training
- `data/`: Data processing and dataset utilities
- `notebooks/`: Colab notebooks for training
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the training notebook in Google Colab
3. Follow the notebook instructions for training

## Training
The model is designed to be trained on Google Colab using free GPU/TPU resources. See the training notebook for details.
