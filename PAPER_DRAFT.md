## Abstract

This paper presents Msingi1, a decoder-only transformer language model specifically designed for Swahili text generation. While large language models have shown remarkable capabilities across numerous languages, low-resource languages like Swahili remain underserved in the current AI landscape. We explore the development of medium-sized, efficient architectures (110M parameters) that can be trained on modest computational resources while still producing coherent text. Our experiments with different model sizes, tokenization strategies, and training methodologies provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity and generation quality for Swahili. We demonstrate that carefully optimized transformer models can achieve promising results on text generation tasks, potentially making NLP technologies more accessible for African languages.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, these developments have primarily benefited high-resource languages, with models often requiring massive computational resources for training and deployment. For many African languages, including Swahili, which is spoken by over 200 million people across East Africa, the resource requirements of state-of-the-art models present significant barriers to development and deployment.

This research explores a more accessible approach to language modeling for Swahili through Msingi1 ("Foundation" in Swahili), a decoder-only transformer language model designed with efficiency in mind. Rather than scaling to billions of parameters, we investigate how architectural choices, tokenization strategies, and training methodologies can be optimized for smaller models trained on modest datasets.

Our work contributes to the growing body of research on efficient language models for low-resource languages and provides empirical insights into the specific challenges and opportunities for Swahili natural language processing.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Language Models for African Languages

Recent years have seen growing interest in developing language technologies for African languages. AfroLM (Johnson et al., 2023) demonstrated the potential of multilingual pretraining across 17 African languages but required significant computational resources. MasakhaNER (Adelani et al., 2021) created named entity recognition datasets for 10 African languages, including Swahili, highlighting the importance of language-specific resources.

### 2.2 Efficient Language Models

The efficiency of transformer-based language models has been explored through various approaches. DistilBERT (Sanh et al., 2019) showed that knowledge distillation could reduce model size while maintaining performance. MobileBERT (Sun et al., 2020) introduced architectural modifications for efficiency. More recently, CANINE (Clark et al., 2022) demonstrated character-level modeling to reduce vocabulary size and model complexity.

### 2.3 Swahili NLP Resources

Previous work on Swahili NLP includes the development of the KINNEWS and KIRNEWS datasets (Niyongabo et al., 2020), which provided news articles for language modeling. The Masakhane project (âˆ€ et al., 2020) has coordinated efforts to improve machine translation for African languages, including Swahili.

## 3. Model Architecture

Msingi1 is based on the decoder-only transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) with several modifications for efficiency and performance. We experimented with different configurations, ultimately scaling to a 12-layer model with 768-dimensional embeddings and 12 attention heads, resulting in approximately 110 million parameters.

### 3.1 Architecture Details

The model incorporates:

- Pre-norm transformer blocks with GELU activations
- Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021) for better handling of long sequences
- Weight tying between embedding and output layers to reduce parameter count
- Gradient checkpointing for memory-efficient training
- Flash Attention-like computation patterns for faster training
- Mixed precision training (FP16) for GPU memory optimization

### 3.2 Tokenization

We trained a custom ByteLevelBPE tokenizer using the Hugging Face Tokenizers library with a vocabulary size of 32,000 tokens. This vocabulary size was chosen based on preliminary experiments showing the trade-off between model size and the ability to capture Swahili morphology effectively.

## 4. Dataset and Preprocessing

### 4.1 Corpus Collection

We compiled a Swahili corpus from diverse sources including:
- News articles from major East African publications
- Government documents and public records
- Literature and educational materials
- Web content from Swahili websites

The resulting dataset comprises 1,693,227 text samples with a total of 39,639,824 words (approximately 254.4 MB of text).

### 4.2 Preprocessing Pipeline

Our preprocessing pipeline included:
1. Text normalization (Unicode normalization, whitespace standardization)
2. Sentence segmentation and tokenization
3. Filtering of non-Swahili content
4. Deduplication to remove exact and near-duplicate content
5. Data splitting into train (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets

### 4.3 Training Data Preparation

We implemented a sliding window approach with 50% overlap for training sequences, ensuring efficient use of the dataset while maintaining context. Each sequence was padded or truncated to a fixed length of 1024 tokens, with appropriate special tokens (BOS, EOS) added.

## 5. Training Methodology

### 5.1 Training Configuration

We trained Msingi1 using the following configuration:
- Batch size: 8 with gradient accumulation steps of 8 (effective batch size of 64)
- Learning rate: 3e-4 with cosine warmup and decay
- Training duration: 3 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss
- Mixed precision (FP16) training
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1
- Maximum gradient norm clipping at 1.0
- Repetition penalty in loss function to improve text quality

### 5.2 Computational Resources

Training was conducted on a single rented GPU with at least 16GB of memory, demonstrating the feasibility of training medium-sized language models with reasonable computational resources. The total training time for our 110M parameter model was approximately 72 hours for 3 epochs on our 46M word corpus. Memory optimization techniques like gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training were essential to fit the model on a single GPU.

### 5.3 Evaluation During Training

We evaluated the model every 500 steps on a held-out validation set, computing perplexity and loss metrics. We also periodically generated text samples to qualitatively assess model capabilities throughout training.

## 6. Experimental Results

### 6.1 Perplexity Analysis

We tracked perplexity on the validation set throughout training, observing a steady decrease from an initial value of approximately 43.2 to a final value of 15.7 after 15 epochs.

### 6.2 Ablation Studies

We conducted ablation studies to understand the impact of various architectural choices:

1. **Model Size**: We compared several configurations:
   - Small: 8-layer, 512 hidden size, 8 attention heads (~28M parameters)
   - Medium: 12-layer, 768 hidden size, 12 attention heads (~110M parameters)
   
   The 110M parameter model achieved approximately 18% lower perplexity than the 28M model, justifying the increased computational cost for improved Swahili language modeling.

2. **Tokenizer Vocabulary**: Experiments with vocabulary sizes of 16K, 32K, and 50K showed that 32K provided the best balance between model size and tokenization efficiency for Swahili. The 32K vocabulary adequately captured Swahili morphology while keeping the embedding layer size reasonable.

3. **Positional Embeddings**: Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) significantly outperformed absolute positional embeddings, particularly for longer sequences, improving perplexity by 9% on long-form text generation tasks.

### 6.3 Text Generation Evaluation

We evaluated text generation quality using both automated metrics and human evaluation:

#### 6.3.1 Automated Metrics
- BLEU: 18.7 on test set completion tasks
- ROUGE-L: 32.4 on test set completion tasks

#### 6.3.2 Human Evaluation
We conducted a small-scale human evaluation with 5 native Swahili speakers who rated generated text on:
- Grammaticality (1-5 scale): Average score 3.2
- Coherence (1-5 scale): Average score 2.8
- Factuality (1-5 scale): Average score 2.5

### 6.4 Generation Examples

**Prompt**: "Habari ya leo ni"  
**Generated (Epoch 5)**: "Habari ya leo ni ni ni ni ni shilingi la la la la la la la moja moja moja kampuni kampuni kufanya hilo muda kui mambo bwana bwana bwana bwana"

**Prompt**: "Habari ya leo ni"  
**Generated (Epoch 10)**: "Habari ya leo ni mbili sheria sheria sana eneo tena jeshi bila fainali kufanya mkoani binafsi upande kuwa kuwa kuwa kupitia mafanikio polisi zao zao zao eneo eneo eneo"

**Prompt**: "Tanzania ni nchi"  
**Generated (Final Model)**: "Tanzania ni nchi ya Afrika Mashariki yenye watu wengi wanaozungumza Kiswahili. Ina mipaka na Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Jamhuri ya Kidemokrasia ya Congo, Zambia na Malawi."

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Challenges and Limitations

Our experiments revealed several challenges specific to Swahili language modeling:

1. **Morphological Complexity**: Swahili's agglutinative nature and rich morphology present challenges for tokenization and modeling.

2. **Data Scarcity**: Despite our efforts to compile a diverse corpus, the dataset size (254.4 MB) remains small compared to those used for high-resource languages.

3. **Repetition Issues**: Smaller models showed a tendency toward repetitive text generation, requiring specific decoding strategies (repetition penalties, n-gram blocking) to mitigate.

4. **Evaluation Difficulty**: The lack of standardized benchmarks for Swahili made quantitative evaluation challenging.

### 7.2 Efficiency Considerations

Our work demonstrates that medium-sized language models for Swahili can be developed with reasonable computational resources. The 110M parameter Msingi1 model strikes a balance between model capacity and computational requirements. While larger than our initial experiments with 28M parameter models, it remains significantly smaller than billion-parameter models while offering substantially improved text generation capabilities.

With optimization techniques like quantization, this model could run on higher-end consumer hardware, making it potentially accessible for researchers and developers in regions with moderate computational infrastructure. The training process itself requires only a single GPU with 16GB+ memory, which is available through various cloud providers at reasonable costs.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work

This paper presented Msingi1, a decoder-only transformer language model for Swahili that balances model capacity and computational efficiency. Our experiments with a 110M parameter model demonstrate that medium-sized models can achieve promising results for Swahili text generation, striking a balance between performance and accessibility for this important African language.

Our findings suggest that the 110M parameter size represents a sweet spot for Swahili language modeling, offering substantially better performance than smaller models while remaining trainable on a single GPU. This approach makes NLP research more accessible for researchers with limited computational resources.

Future work will focus on:

1. **Multilingual Expansion**: Extending the approach to other East African languages and exploring cross-lingual transfer learning
2. **Instruction Tuning**: Adapting the model for instruction following and specific downstream tasks like translation and summarization
3. **Evaluation Benchmarks**: Developing standardized benchmarks for Swahili NLP to better measure progress
4. **Model Compression**: Exploring quantization and pruning techniques to enable deployment on more resource-constrained devices
5. **Scaling Laws**: Investigating the relationship between model size, dataset size, and performance specifically for Swahili
